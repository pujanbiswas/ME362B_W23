    "Vibrational relaxation influences the thermodynamic state of gases in supersonic and hypersonic flows, and modeling of the vibrational relaxation process affects the design of heat shielding for hypersonic and reentry vehicles. Supersonic compression and expansion rapidly change the translational and rotational energies while the vibrational energy evolves more slowly due to vibrational relaxation. The following two questions investigate the effects of vibrational relaxation in a compression flow behind an oblique shock wave and in an expansion flow through a supersonic nozzle. Applications of oblique shocks include supersonic inlets and bow shock in reentry flows, while applications of supersonic nozzles include ramjet, scramjet, and rocket exhaust to produce thrust and gas dynamic lasers."
